## Data for Evaluating Species Distribution Modelling Methods

This package consists of a collection of datasets that can be used to compare species distribution models. There are data for 6 regions in the world, for a total of 226 anonymised species including birds, vascular plants, reptiles and bats. Each data set has presence-only (and optionally background) training data to build models, and presence/absence data to evaluate models.


## Installation

You can install the package from `R` with the `remotes` package. Like this

```
library(remotes)
remotes::install_github("rspatial/disdat")
```
